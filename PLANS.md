# ðŸ§° Workshop

### [Unified []\()](@jotdoc/unify/README.md)

- Image titles may be displayed as \<figcaptions>   
- ~~`""` and `''` as optional substitutes for `[]`?~~
- Can't "link" to image paths. Does anyone care?

### [Columns](@jotdoc/columns/README.md)


 - ~~Considering `|:`, `|_`, or `#Â·` for header definition~~
 - ~~`=`* or `-`* under text no longer makes them headers. Good riddance(?)~~



### [Alignment](@jotdoc/align/README.md)

 - ~~Opening `>` conflict with blockquotes; require it use trailing space `>Â·`~~
 - ~~For inline left/right align: closing delimiter optional?~~   
 - ~~is `>Text|` more readable?~~
 - Justify (`<...>`): interference with HTML tags?

# ðŸ’¡ Ideas

### Wrap break (`___` or `***`)
<!-- <br style="clear:both"/> -->
- When writing a paragraph to the side of a floated image, use `***` on a new line to begin your next paragraph right below it.
- Use alone to prevent anything from wrapping into the space beside the image
